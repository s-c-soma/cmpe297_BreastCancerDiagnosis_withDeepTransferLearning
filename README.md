2. Enter your token in 1.1. 

3. After youve entered your token once run cells under 1.0 once. Then so long as you dont terminate your session, even if gets killed/crashes,
next time you dont need to run cells under 1.0 again. You start from 2.0. However, if you terminate your session, you will need to repeat running 1.0.
