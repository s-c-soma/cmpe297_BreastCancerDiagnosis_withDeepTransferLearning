#  Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Using Combined CNN-RNN Architecture with Deep Transfer Learning

CMPE 297 Deep Learning Project : Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Using Combined CNN-RNN Architecture with Deep Transfer Learning


To run latest colab, please do the following
1. Setup Kaggle API
Steps to have kaggle API working in colab are listed here

2. Enter your token in 1.1. 

3. After youve entered your token once run cells under 1.0 once. Then so long as you dont terminate your session, even if gets killed/crashes,
next time you dont need to run cells under 1.0 again. You start from 2.0. However, if you terminate your session, you will need to repeat running 1.0.

## Kubeflow Setup for Cancer Classification

**kubeflow** folder contains all the necessary code needed to create, update and deploy a pipeline to kubeflow. Please use the template.ipynb file as a reference on how to execute these commands. This notebook must exist on a Jupyter notebook on GCP.
